// just posted what i was working on for the hangman assignment in case anyone wants to pull any ideas from it or use it. It's not complete but its a start! 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Hangman {
    private static final boolean testingMode = true;
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int count=0;
        if (count==20){
            System.out.println("Maximum number of games played");
            return;
        }
    chooseDifficulty();
    game(5, 6);
    }
    public static void chooseDifficulty(){
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your difficulty: Easy (e), Intermediate (i), or Hard (h): ");
        String difficulty = scanner.next();
        char charDifficulty = difficulty.charAt(0);
        difficulty=String.valueOf(charDifficulty);
        System.out.println(difficulty);
        if (difficulty.equalsIgnoreCase("h")){
            //pass number of guesses (15) and spaces for character (4)
        }
        if (difficulty.equalsIgnoreCase("i")){

        }
        if (difficulty.equalsIgnoreCase("e")){

        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Invalid difficulty. Try Again...");
            chooseDifficulty();
        }


    }
    public static void game(int numGuesses, int spaces){
        String secret = RandomWord.newWord();
        System.out.println(secret);
        String displayWord="";
        for (int i=0; i<secret.length();i++){
            displayWord=displayWord + "-";
        }
        System.out.println("The word is: " + displayWord);
        for (int i =0; i< numGuesses; i++){
            System.out.println("Please enter the letter you want to guess: ");
            char letter= Scanner.next();

        }



    }
}
